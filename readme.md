Description
===========

A project where I will place generic base utilities for C programming on an
"as needed" basis. The idea is that everything should be very pretty simple, 
statically linkable by modules and compilable with GCC and Visual Studio.

As of today is a C++ compiler with no C99-C11 support, so sometimes I may fall
back to C++ to emulate some C99-C11 features.

Now the library is divided in some very tiny sublibraries to avoid bloating. The
intention is to don't make a big monolithic library for these basic things.

1. (base) Base library
----------------------

Depends on: -

This is the basic utilities library, mostly header-based and heavily relying on
"static inline" and macros. It contains:

* Platform detection (very primitive, will get bigger).

* Static integer math.

* Integer math.

* Timestamp wrappers.

* Humble fixed-size basic data structures (mostly for microcontrollers) as a
 ringbuffer, ordered ringbuffer and array based linked lists
 (to save size on pointers)

* The famous BSD data structures (lists and trees).

* A futex + atomics semaphore based on the Monotonic clock for Linux (POSIX
  doesn't provide this).

* Wrappers for atomics.

* Wrappers for thread manipulation (adding as needed). As of now mutexes and
  condition variables aren't wrapped (I personally try to code multithreaded
  applications either by message passing (through lock-free queues) or by
  using cooperative scheduling).

It depends on the platform which functions are or aren't "static inline", so it
might happen that in some platform some things compile as header only and in
another one it does need some definitions on .c files. It's recommended to use
this library as a static library on all platforms.

2. (noblock) Non (OS) blocking queues
-------------------------------------

Depends on: base

Some non blocking queues (in the sense that never aquire OS locks (mutexes,
semaphores ...)

* The beautiful and famous Dmitry Djukov's MPMC lockfree queue with some addons:
  1. Can be used as MPSC and SPMC.
  2. Uses the high part of the CAS'ed counter as a broadcast signaling mechanism
    that can communicate with producers (on MP mode) or consumers (on MC mode)
    almost for free.

...More to come as needed...

3. (task_queue) MPSC task queue with delayed/scheduled tasks
------------------------------------------------------------

Depends on: base, noblock

A queue for worker/event dispatcher threads. Based on wrapping timestamps orde-
red in an array based associative container, some lockfree queues and a
semaphore.

4. (serial) Serial port thin wrapper
-------------------------------------

Depends on: base

5. (getopt)
-----------

Depends on: base headers.

A non-standard implementation of "getopt" that removes the global variables and
avoids some segfaults found in some (major) POSIX implementations.

Current status
==============

Under development.

-Linux:

 All the tests pass on Linux.

 Serial is untested.

-Windows:

 All the tests pass on Windows.

 Serial is untested.

 Getopt is untested (but it contanins no platform specific code...)

Credits and Used resources
==========================

* Dmitry Djukov for making its queue algorithms public.
  [http://www.1024cores.net/]
* William Woodall and John Harrison for their serial code at
  [https://github.com/wjwwood/serial]
* Thomas Nixon, Jonathan Heathcote for the macro hackery at
  [https://github.com/18sg/uSHET]
* Kim Gr√§sman for his getopt port. [https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port]
* My former employer Diadrom AB. Some parts of this library were written while
  working there. 

Compilers
=================

-Visual Studio 2013
-GCC 4.8.1

Folders
=======

* dependencies: External dependencies, as of now cmocka for the unit tests and
 premake5-alpha for building.
* build/premake: The build script.
* build/state: Place where the generated binaries are located after compilation.
* build/*platform*: Folder where premake generates the makefiles, VS solutions
, etc.
* "include": -
* "test": -
* "src": -

Build on Linux (GCC)
=================

1. If you are planning to run the unit tests you need CMake, as cmocka uses it
as its build system. It's mostly sure that every distro has a package for it.

2. Go to the "dependencies" folder and run the "prepare_dependencies.sh" script.
Check that everything builds.

3. Go to the "build/premake" folder and execute "./premake5 gmake".
This generates the makefile.

4. The makefile is now on the "build/linux" folder. If you specify
"config=debug" yo will build debug binaries. Binaries are placed under
"build/stage/linux".

Build on Windows
===============

1. If you are planning to run the unit tests you need CMake, as cmocka uses it
as its build system.

2. Go to the "dependencies" folder and follow the instructions on the
"prepare_dependencies_windows.txt" document.

3. Go to the "build/premake" folder and execute "./premake5 vs2013".
This generates the visual studio solution on "build/premake/windows".

4. You can build either through the solution or through the
"build/premake/build_vs2013.bat" script. Binaries are placed under
"build/stage/windows".
