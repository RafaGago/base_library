Premake
--------

1. Go to ".\code" and unzip "premake-5.0.0-alpha6", 
2. Build the solution (under the "premake-5.0.0-alpha6\build" folder).
3. Copy or link
   "base_library\dependencies\code\premake-5.0.0-alpha6\bin\**debug or release**\premake5.exe" 
   to
   "base_library\build\premake\"
4. You can erase the "code\premake-5.0.0-alpha6" folder if you want.
   
Cmocka
-------
 
This is just necessary if you are building the test projects (stress testing
projects will still work, as they don't depend on cmocka).
 
1. Unpack "cmocka-1.0.1"
2. Install cmake (https://cmake.org)
3. Go to "cmocka-1.0.1"
4. open a terminal and run "md build && cd build"
5. "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\..\..\cmocka -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_STATIC_LIB=On .."
6. Build the cmocka .sln file that "appeared cmocka-1.0.1\build" (current
   folder). First the "cmocka_static" project and then the "INSTALL" project.
7. Now the output is generated at "dependencies\cmocka", but the static library
   in the "dependencies\cmocka\lib" folder constains the .lib library that
   helps auto-linking with the DLL on "dependencies\cmocka\bin". As we want
   to link statically we have to overwrite this lib with the one contained in
   "\base_library\dependencies\code\cmocka-1.0.1\build\src\Debug\cmocka.lib"
8. You can erase the "code\cmocka-1.0.1" folder if you want.
